Loop
----

.. versionadded:: 2.2

``--loop x`` defines the number of runs we want before exiting:

-  ``X`` where X is a negative value means infinite, like ``-1`` (default)
-  ``0`` means that we donâ€™t run any crawling job (useful when used with rest).
-  ``X`` where X is a positive value is the number of runs before it stops.

If you want to scan your hard drive only once, run with ``--loop 1``.


Restart
-------

.. versionadded:: 2.2

You can tell FSCrawler that it must restart from the beginning by using
``--restart`` option:

.. code:: sh

   bin/fscrawler job_name --restart

In that case, the ``{job_name}/_status.json`` file will be removed.

Rest
----

.. versionadded:: 2.3

If you want to run the :ref:`rest-service` without scanning
your hard drive, launch with:

.. code:: sh

   bin/fscrawler --rest --loop 0
